Task 2a

I see problem in using different prices and city/country,
it could be divided into three tables, one for German,
second for English and third for French. It would speed up
the process of finding insurance for specific country/city.
Also extra could be splitted into columns, instead of 
name, price Euro, price USD, it could have extra_name, extra_price_euro,
extra_price_usd.
Same for insurance instead of name, price Euro, price USD, it could
have insurance_name, insurance_price_euro, insurance_price_usd.

Task 2b

id - int
city - varchar
city_en - varchar
city_fr - varchar
country - varchar
country_en - varchar
country_fr - varchar
extra - varchar
extra1 - varchar
extra2 - varchar
insurance - varchar
insurance1 - varchar
insurance2 - varchar
price_eur - float
price_usd - float
camper - varchar

Task 2c

Index is an column that provides speed in searching data in table.
Index should be unique, unchangeable, nonnull, so if we want to search
one thing we can use index to get it. In this example I would use 
id as an index, beacuse its auto incremented so each offer created
will have their index different from others.

Task 2d

Foreign key is a column in table that refer to primary key in other
table. We should use them if we want to create relation between tables,
if table doesnt have any relation we shouldnt use them.

In this example I wouldn't use foreign key, beacuse there are no
relations.
